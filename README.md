My name is Jonathan and I am an entering Bioengineering graduate student at UCLA! In a past life (undergrad), I studied a Computer Science and Computational Biology. I'm looking to apply my knowledge of ML and stats to my bioengineering research. Some current projects include:
- Early bacteria biofilm formation in _Vibrio cholera_
- Peptide-membrane interactions via small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS)
- Using transfomer-based embeddings of amino acid sequences to study peptide families

## 
- 🔭 I’m currently working on peptides and bacteria!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning transformers and Julia.
- 💬 Ask me about my ever growing love for [JuliaLang](https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia).
