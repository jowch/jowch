My name is Jonathan and I am an entering Bioengineering graduate student at UCLA! I'm currently studying bacteria biofilm formation working. In a past life (undergrad), I studied a Computer Science and Computational Biology. I'm looking to apply my knowledge of ML and stats to my bioengineering research. On the side, I have plans to write some [Medium](https://medium.com/@jowch) articles about some of the interesting ideas I have come across in my academic journey 👨‍🔬. Wish me luck!

- 🔭 I’m currently working on bacteria!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning timeseries analysis, differential equations, and Julia.
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with analyzing trends across lineages of bacteria.
- 💬 Ask me about my ever growing love for [JuliaLang](https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia).
